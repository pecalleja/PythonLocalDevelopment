# Python Local Development üêç

This is a Sandbox environment to practice my Python skills.

I'm following several roadmaps and courses and this repository is journal of the problems I resolve along the way.


#### **[NeetCode Roadmap](src/neetcode/README.md)**

The NeetCode roadmap is a super useful guide designed to help you master coding interviews. It lays out a clear,
step-by-step plan to learn important data structures and algorithms, starting from beginner-friendly concepts and
working up to more advanced ones. The idea is to give you a structured path to follow, with curated problems from
LeetCode that you can practice along the way.
